# 4.3 Summarize documents

Azure Cognitive Services, specifically the **Azure Language Service's Summarization** capability, provides advanced extractive text summarization to condense complex documents like **Statements of Work (SoWs)** into concise summaries.

By integrating this capability with the **PostgreSQL Azure_AI extension**, you can dynamically generate summaries for documents stored in relational tables, streamlining workflows and improving document accessibility.

## Summarizing Statements of Work (SoWs)

SoWs in the financial industry often contain extensive details about project scope, deliverables, and milestones. Summarizing these documents into a few sentences allows decision-makers to quickly grasp the key information without reading through lengthy documents.

### Key Benefits for Summarization

- **Time Efficiency**: Quickly identify critical information from long-form documents.
- **Enhanced Accessibility**: Summaries provide concise overviews, improving decision-making processes.
- **Scalable Automation**: Automatically generate summaries for large volumes of documents without manual intervention.

Azure's Summarization API within the **Language Service** enables extractive summarization, creating human-like summaries that convey the document's essence rather than just extracting key phrases.

## Using Azure_AI Extension with the `azure_cognitive` Schema

The Azure_AI extension integrates Azure Cognitive Services' Summarization capabilities directly into SQL workflows, allowing the generation of extractive summaries of SoWs or other financial documents using simple SQL commands.

## Extractive Summarization

The extension's extractive summarization capabilities provide a unique, natural-language summary that encapsulates the overall intent of the original text. This is performed by calling the `azure_cognitive.summarize_extractive` function within the database. This will generate a 2-3 sentence summary of the text passed in.

```sql
azure_cognitive.summarize_extractive('This is a document text', 'en', 2)
```

Consider the following PostgreSQL table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sows (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    number text NOT NULL,
    vendor_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    start_date DATE NOT NULL,
    end_date DATE NOT NULL,
    budget DECIMAL(18,2) NOT NULL,
    document text NOT NULL,
    metadata jsonb,
    summary text,
    FOREIGN KEY (vendor_id) REFERENCES vendors (id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

```sql
-- Update the summary column with extractive summaries
UPDATE sows
SET summary = azure_cognitive.summarize_extractive(metadata::text, 'en', 2);
```

```sql
SELECT azure_cognitive.summarize_extractive('This is a document text', 'en', 2);
```

## Insert Document Summary on Database Insert

Leveraging the `azure_cognitive.summarize_extractive` method of the `azure_ai` extension, the database scripts are able to make calls to generate a document summary on INSERT or UPDATE.

Here's an example INSERT script used by the application when creating SOW records that includes the summarization:

```sql
INSERT INTO sows (number, start_date, end_date, budget, document, metadata, embeddings, summary, vendor_id)
VALUES (
    $1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, 
    azure_openai.create_embeddings('embeddings', $7, throw_on_error => FALSE, max_attempts => 1000, retry_delay_ms => 2000),
    azure_cognitive.summarize_extractive($7, 'en', 2)
    $8)
RETURNING *;
```

## API Implementation

The `/sows/` HTTP POST method of the REST API contains code that inserts or updates SOWs based on the document uploaded. The code for this is within the `src/api/app/routers/sows.py` file. Open it now in Visual Studio Code and explore the code within the `async def analyze_sow` method that contain the code to ingest SOW documents, including the portion that performs the database INSERT or UPDATE on the `sows` table.

You can expand the section below to see the specific section of code that performs the `azure_ai` call to generate the document summary, within the database INSERT and UPDATE statements.

    ```python linenums="103" title="src/api/app/routers/sows.py"
    # Create SOW in the database
    async with pool.acquire() as conn:
        if sow_id is None:
            # Create new SOW
            row = await conn.fetchrow('''
                INSERT INTO sows (number, start_date, end_date, budget, document, metadata, summary, vendor_id)
                VALUES (
                $1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, 
                azure_cognitive.summarize_extractive($7, 'en', 2),
                $8)
                RETURNING *;
            ''', sow_number, start_date, end_date, budget, documentName, json.dumps(metadata), full_text, vendor_id)
        else:
            # Update existing SOW with new document
            row = await conn.fetchrow('''
                UPDATE sows
                SET start_date = $1,
                    end_date = $2,
                    budget = $3,
                    document = $4,
                    metadata = $5,
                    summary = azure_cognitive.summarize_extractive($6, 'en', 2)
                WHERE id = $7
                RETURNING *;
            ''', start_date, end_date, budget, documentName, json.dumps(metadata), full_text, sow_id)
    ```
